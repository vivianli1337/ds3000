    "### The Condorcet Jury Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Condorcet Jury Theorem is a political science and probability theory concept named after the French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet. The theorem explores the relationship between the accuracy of individual decision-makers (voters or jurors) and the accuracy of the collective decision made by the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each individual in the group has a probability p of making the correct decision (independently of the others), where 0.5 < p < 1. In other words, each individual is more likely than not to make the correct decision.\n",
    "- The individuals make their decisions independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these conditions, the Condorcet Jury Theorem states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the group size (number of individuals) increases, the probability that the group makes the correct decision approaches 1 (certainty).\n",
    "If each individual's probability of making the correct decision is above 0.5, then adding more individuals to the group will improve the group's decision-making accuracy.\n",
    "Conversely, if each individual's probability of making the correct decision is below 0.5, then adding more individuals to the group will reduce the group's decision-making accuracy.\n",
    "In simpler terms, the theorem suggests that, under the specified conditions, the \"wisdom of the crowd\" prevails. A larger group of individuals, each with a better-than-random chance of making the correct decision, will collectively make better decisions than any single individual or a smaller group. However, if the individual's probability of making the correct decision is below 0.5, the group's collective decision-making would worsen with additional members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Condorcet Jury Theorem has applications in various fields, such as political science, economics, and decision-making theory. It provides a basis for understanding how collective decision-making can lead to more accurate outcomes, given that certain conditions are met.\n",
