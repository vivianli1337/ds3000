The reddit API requires that we supply a descriptive value for the 'User-Agent'. The User-Agent attribute is used to define the caller, the browser, or the application being used to make the API request. In otherwords, reddit is telling us that we can freely access their database via a documented API call, but they want to know who's calling! Additional rules for using the reddit API can be found here."
